Hi ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Omid Asadinia and Iâ€™m a computer science graduated. Iâ€™m interested in the AI, ML and related fields because it allows me to apply my math, science, and programming knowledge to solve exciting and valuable problems.

I am also interested in the future of technology because even though computer technology has come a long way since I was a kid playing with basic calculators, there are still parts of our lives that depend on computers. I want to be able to help make those parts better!
